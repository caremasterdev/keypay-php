A client library for the [KeyPay API](https://api.keypay.com.au/), built from the provided [OpenAPI v2 specification](https://api.keypay.com.au/swagger-au.json) using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://opencollective.com/openapi_generator)

## Requirements
- PHP 7.4
  
## Installation

This package is not available on Packagist yet. Therefore, add this to your `composer.json` to install

You can install the package via composer:

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/caremasterdev/keypay-php"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage
Before resource requests can be made, the application must be authorised. KeyPay supports other authorisation flows, but this package assumes you're using OAuth2

### Authorisation Code Flow
See [Healyhatman/oauth2-keypay](https://github.com/Healyhatman/oauth2-keypay) for instructions on obtaining Oauth2 credentials

## Interacting with the API
Once you have a valid access token, you can instantiate a KeypayPHP\Application, and use it to help build the appropriate API object and the desired methods.

### Insantiate an Application
```php
$application = new \KeypayPHP\Application($access_token);
```
### Access a particular API Group
All of the API classes are available under ``OpenAPI\Client\Api``. Using ``forApi()`` will allow you to access the API using your application object's transport
```php
$employees = $application->forApi('\OpenAPI\Client\Api\EmployeeApi')->auEmployeeGetEmployees($business_id);
```
